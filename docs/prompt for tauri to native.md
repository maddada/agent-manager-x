I started this app using tauri but i want to shift all of it to just be native swift code (like the native-mini-viewer it has  in this folder /Users/madda/dev/z_OpenSourceEdits/agent-manager-x/src-tauri/native-mini-viewer)

please create a new folder in this location: /Users/madda/dev/agent-manager-x

in this new folder start a new swift ui project and copy all of the features that are in this app there

read this readme to understand more about this app: README.md

I want you to match the UX exactly.

no need to port over theming at the start just keep 1 light and 1 dark theme for now

port over all the other settings though

make sure to port over the menu bar icon and how it works

use sub agents for work to reduce token consumption on your self since you will be the orchestrator agent

no need to run too many parallel agents, take your time with this just do it perfectly

make sure to avoid 2 agents editing the same files when you kick them off

copy over the miniviewer exactly as it is just adjust stuff related to tauri part there but the functionality and ui is perfect now

please be thorough and take all the time you need until you finish this. don't ask me any questions i'm not here. just write any decisions you made to a DECISIONS.md file

also please yourself and subagents write summarized updates into PROGRESS.md to keep track of work

here's screenshot of the main ui

and here are the settings
